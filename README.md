We used [cellSNP-lite](https://github.com/brianpenghe/2024_AT2_organoids/tree/main/cellsnp-lite) to call the SNPs for each donor from Bulk RNA-seq.

We used the [starsolo](https://github.com/brianpenghe/2024_AT2_organoids/tree/main/mapping) to map the scRNA-seq data.

We used the [souporcell](https://github.com/brianpenghe/2024_AT2_organoids/tree/main/souporcell) to de-multiplex the scRNA-seq data, based on the [genotypes](https://github.com/brianpenghe/2024_AT2_organoids/blob/main/souporcell/merged.vcf) of the four donors, inferred by cellSNP-lite.
